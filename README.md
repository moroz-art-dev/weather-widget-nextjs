# Weather Widget Next.js

A responsive weather widget built using Next.js that displays the current weather and forecast data. It supports different widget sizes (small, wide, large) and adapts to the user's location using geolocation. The widget allows users to search for weather data by city and uses Material-UI for styling.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Supports small (2x2), wide (4x2), and large (4x4) widget sizes.
- **Current Weather & Forecast**: Displays current weather conditions and a forecast for the next few days.
- **Geolocation**: Automatically fetches weather data based on the user's location.
- **City Search**: Allows users to search for weather data by city.
- **Theming**: Light and dark mode support using Material-UI's theming.
- **API Integrations**: Uses OpenWeatherMap and GeoNames APIs for weather and location data.

## Getting Started

   cd weather-widget-nextjs
```

2. **Install the dependencies**:

```bash
   npm install
```

3. **Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your API keys**:

```

   NEXT_PUBLIC_GEONAMES_USERNAME=your_geonames_username
```

4. **Scripts**:

```bash
   npm run dev: Starts the development server.
   npm run build: Builds the application for production.
   npm run start: Starts the production server.
   npm run lint: Runs ESLint for code linting.
   npm run test: Runs unit tests using Jest.
